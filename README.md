This repo shows some common challenges and their solutions on JavaScript, I divided them on small modules, also I'm using <a href="https://jestjs.io/" target="_blank">Jest</a>

### How to work with it:

* Clone the repo
* Install dependencies:
  - ``npm install``
* Add a new Module.
* Run the tests:
  - ``npm run test``
